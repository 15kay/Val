    <h1>Love Letter </h1>
    <p id="para1">My Dearst Wife, I remember the days when love felt so far away, like a dream I could never quite reach. It was as if I was meant to live without it, uncertain whether I’d ever find someone who truly understood me. But then I saw you. Something changed. In that moment, I knew that I had found something real, something worth fighting for. You saw past all the walls I built, past the fear, and you saw my heart. You saw me for who I really was and gave us a chance, and now, here you are, in my life, making everything feel so much clearer.</p>
    <p id="para2">It wasn’t easy, I won’t lie. It took time—so much time—but every single moment led me to the beautiful reality of calling you mine. Through the doubts, the confusion, and the pain, you stayed. You stayed with me, and eventually, love came, and I knew this was it. You were worth the wait, Joyce, worth every second, every single day. Through all the storms, through all the rain, you have been my sunshine, guiding me when I couldn’t find my way.</p>
    <p id="para3">You’re the reason my heart beats this strong. You’re my forever. You are right where I belong. I look at you, and I see everything—your smile, the light in your eyes, the warmth that comes from just being near you. I know this journey was hard, but it brought me to you, and for that, I will forever be thankful. You’ve taught me patience, grace, and love in ways I never imagined. You've opened my heart to things I never knew I could feel.</p>
    <p id="para4">And now, here we are, holding onto each other, in this space that we’ve created together. Every moment with you feels like the most beautiful thing I’ve ever experienced. It hasn’t been easy, but we found our light, and now everything feels so right. We’ve had our moments, our fights, and our miscommunication, but through it all, you’ve been my constant, my day, my night, my love.</p>
    <p id="para5">You were worth every single second of waiting. Through every storm, every moment of doubt, you’ve been my rock, my sunshine, the one who lights up my life. Now, as I look at you, I promise you this: I will never let you go. I will hold you close through every high, every low, every challenge that comes our way. You took a chance on me, and I took a chance on you. And now, here we are, soaring together, love high in the sky.</p>
    <p id="para6">Joyce, you are my forever. I will love you, cherish you, and honor you for the rest of my life. You are worth more than I could ever express in words. This is our song, the song of our love, the one we’ll carry with us forever. Through every moment, every challenge, every joy, I will hold you near and love you deeper than I ever thought was possible.</p>
    <p id="para7">Thank you, Joyce. Thank you for bringing me to this beautiful place, for being the light in my life, and for making everything worth it. I love you more than words could ever say.</p>
